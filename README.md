## What are we doing?

### The What  

* **When a flaming rock from outer space crashed into Lake Michigan on February 6th, it created waves…literally!** This inspired us at the Adler Planetarium to ask how we could harness this event and use it to create accessible and engaging educational content. [(Click here to see what it’s inspired so far!)](http:://bit.ly/aquariusproject)
* **Enter the Aquarius Project inspired Open Science Engagement Platform!**
* **We are using ongoing science stories to produce interactive hands-on lesson plans in STEM.**  We are using real science happening today to engage students not only with its relevance but with their ability to contribute, and packaging all that into ready to deliver lesson plans for teachers to use.

#### These free, open-source lesson packages offer:
   * Paired video content with in-class projects
   * [Suggested assignments, guided learning strategies](https://www.discoverdesign.org/challenges/youth-authored-design-magnetic-underwater-meteorite-sled) 
   * [Interactive/hands-on samples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPvlK-0ybiw)
   * [Citizen Science Engagement portals for participating in the real science](https://zooniverse.org)
   * Opportunities to talk with scientists
   * Access to involved museums

*Science stories you can binge!*

### The Why  

Often students can view scientific exploration as something left to the professionals; premade science experiments in the classroom can often feel disconnected to the story of ongoing explorations. Using a strong, engaging narrative, coupled with hands-on applicable science, young explorers can more easily find themselves the main characters in a story of discovery they are helping to write.
Our mission is to address 3 major hurdles often faced in STEM education: 1) Science is inaccessible, 2) Science seems unrelatable, and 3) It can be difficult and time consuming to develop new and relevant lesson plans that are both engaging and meet [NGSS guidelines](https://www.nextgenscience.org/get-to-know).

1)    **Science is inaccessible.** “Science is for geniuses”, “I’m not smart enough”, and “It’s too hard” are phrases I have often heard in my own journey toward becoming a scientist both uttered from myself and others. The simple fact is that this isn’t true. When explained well and built upon existing knowledge and understanding (scaffolding and cross-concepting), the fundamentals of the STEMs and scientific thinking are easy to grasp and practice. Through our hands-on, personal inflection, and scaffolded approach we aim to provide an environment for students to discover their own capabilities at succeeding in thinking like a scientist.

2)    **Science seems unrelatable.** Unless you’re already planning on being a scientist, who cares about DNA, thermodynamics, or the water cycle? How does plate tectonics apply to me, or more accurately, “When am I ever going to need to know this?” Honestly, these are tough questions to answer. So, we take a different approach to making the science relatable, we want to make it active, current, and all about the student. Our paired videos and supplemental external links (scientist bios, Instagram, websites, YouTube videos, etc) are aimed at showing a diversity of stereotype-breaking scientists across all ages, backgrounds, specialties, and personalities. 

3)    **Developing [NGSS](https://www.nextgenscience.org/get-to-know) -based lesson plans.** The Next Generation Science Standards were established in 2013. Since then 19 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) have adopted the standards with 21 states interested in following. This transition

*Hey I’m Chris!* I’m a member of the [2018 Mozilla Open Leaders Fellowship](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/announcing-mozilla-open-leaders-round-5-fc16be27336d), a full-time program manager at [The Adler Planetarium](https://www.adlerplanetarium.org), a  [visual artist](http://www.the12daysofagreatwhitechristmas.com),  and [actor](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1591332/) with an MFA in performance from the [Old Globe Theare](https://www.graduateacting.com/).  My love of science and the arts drives me to highlight the importance of their intersection.  Fostering creative engagement with current science exploration helps to increase access with content that can feel unapproachable, and careers for many that seem unimaginable.        

*Hi, I’m Kennen!* I'm a full-time PhD fellow at Northwestern University and part-time social media science communicator. Growing up I was often bored in class and found the lessons unrelatable and uninspiring. As I continued on my academic journey I was inundated with mind numbing lecture/worksheet based curriculum that just wasn't cutting it. Fed up with these non-engaging pedagogies, I decided it was time to do something and make a change. This project is designed to provide teachers with engaging NGSS aligned lesson plans that offer interactive multi-media content paired with museums, institutions, and campuses across the nation/globe.

### What do we need?

**You!** In whatever way you can help.

We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love you to contribute with the following: 

* Translators for existing lesson content 
* Transcribers for video content to increase accessibility
* Volunteer resources for curriculum packages (access to specimens, 3-D printing, etc)
* Collaborative institutions for content expertise and demonstrations of careers and inside looks at the STEMs (also free or discounted passes for classrooms to visit museums or even institutes would be awesome)
* Filming experts + production experts
* Website design for a fully interactive hub (future app design) (maybe some app development in the future)
* Input from educators on what they would like to see, what topics they would like covered

### Contact Us

If you want to report a problem or suggest an enhancement we'd love for you to open an issue at this github repository. But you can also contact Chris by email (cbresky AT adlerplanetarium.org) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/MrChrisBresky)
