## What are we doing?

### The What  

* **When a flaming rock from outer space crashed into Lake Michigan on February 6th, it created waves…literally!** This inspired us at the Adler Planetarium to ask how we could harness this event and use it to create accessible and engaging educational content. [(Click here to see what it’s inspired so far!)](http:://bit.ly/aquariusproject)

### The Aquarius Project: Open Science Engagement Platform

* **We are using ongoing science stories to produce interactive hands-on lesson plans in STEM.**  We are using real science happening today to engage students not only with its relevance but with their ability to contribute, and packaging all that into ready to deliver lesson plans for teachers to use.

#### These free, open-source lesson packages offer:
   * Paired video content with in-class projects
   * [Suggested assignments, guided learning strategies](https://www.discoverdesign.org/challenges/youth-authored-design-magnetic-underwater-meteorite-sled) 
   * [Interactive/hands-on samples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPvlK-0ybiw)
   * [Citizen Science Engagement portals for participating in the real science](https://zooniverse.org)
   * Opportunities to talk with scientists
   * Access to involved museums

## The Why  

Often students can view scientific exploration as something left to the professionals; premade science experiments in the classroom can often feel disconnected to the story of ongoing explorations. Using a strong, engaging narrative, coupled with hands-on applicable science, and real-time connection to professional scientists, young explorers can more easily find themselves the main characters in a story of discovery they are helping to write.

Our mission is to address 3 major hurdles often faced in STEM education: 1) Science is inaccessible, 2) Science seems unrelatable, and 3) It can be difficult and time consuming to develop new and relevant lesson plans that are both engaging and meet [NGSS guidelines](https://www.nextgenscience.org/get-to-know).

1)    **Science is inaccessible.** “Science is for geniuses”, “I’m not smart enough”, and “It’s too hard” are phrases I have often heard in my own journey toward becoming a scientist both uttered from myself and others. When explained well and built upon existing knowledge and understanding (scaffolding and cross-concepting), the fundamentals of the STEMs and scientific thinking are easy to grasp and practice. 

2)    **Science seems unrelatable.** Unless you’re already planning on being a scientist, who cares about DNA, thermodynamics, or the water cycle? Or more accurately, “When am I ever going to need to know this?” These are tough questions to answer. So, we take a different approach to making the science relatable, we want to make it active, current, and all about the student. Paired videos and supplemental external links (scientist interaction, Instagram, websites, YouTube videos, etc) are aimed at showing a diversity of stereotype-breaking scientists across all ages, backgrounds, specialties, and personalities. 

3)    **Developing [NGSS](https://www.nextgenscience.org/get-to-know) -based lesson plans.** The Next Generation Science Standards were established in 2013. Since then 19 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) have adopted the standards with 21 states interested in following. This transition 

## How can you help?

 ### 1. Be Curious. 
 [Learn about the meteor fall that sparked this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey5PA_Sn0n4). 
 
   * Ask a question & post to Twitter with **#AquariusAMA** that you'd like a scientist/educator to answer for you inspired by [the project](https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/education/far-horizons/the-aquarius-project/). (**Example:** *"How hot was the meteorite (space rock) when it hit the water?"*) 
     * **Science Professionals will be monitoring #AquariusAMA from 1-2pm CST (6-7pm UTC) on May 9th & 10th during the Global Sprint
   * Post your question and the response you receive! We'll use these to help design and direct new lesson content. [Post your questions and answers here!](https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/2) 
 
 ### 2. Be a Translator. 
 Help us translate the text from one of our digital lessons into another language. [Contribute here!](https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/1)
 
 ### 3. Be a Resource Contributor.
We invite scientists (and citizen scientists) of diverse backgrounds to contribute resources (online links, twitter/email for direct communication) that could help answer questions from #2 and help be a resource for future students/educators. [Post them here!](https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/3)
 
 ### 4. Be a Storyteller. 
If you are a science communicator, educator, scientist, or citizen scientist with a camera, record yourself answering a question from [Issue 2]((https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/2) ). Record from your phone or laptop (clear sound but doesn't need to be fancy) and [post your video link here](https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/4). 
 
* Volunteer resources for curriculum packages (access to specimens, 3-D printing, etc)
* Collaborative institutions for content expertise and demonstrations of careers and inside looks at the STEMs (also free or discounted passes for classrooms to visit museums or even institutes would be awesome)

* Input from educators on what they would like to see, what topics they would like covered

*Hey I’m Chris!* I’m a member of the [2018 Mozilla Open Leaders Fellowship](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/announcing-mozilla-open-leaders-round-5-fc16be27336d), a full-time program manager at [The Adler Planetarium](https://www.adlerplanetarium.org), a  [visual artist](http://www.the12daysofagreatwhitechristmas.com),  with my MFA in [acting](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1591332/).  My love of science and the arts drives me to highlight the importance of their intersection.  Fostering creative engagement with current science exploration helps to increase access with content that can feel unapproachable, and careers for many that seem unimaginable.

*Hi, I’m Kennen!* I'm a full-time PhD fellow at Northwestern University and part-time [social media science communicator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_V-JuHBZ1ZtTaJliRjN9pw). Growing up I was often bored in class and found the lessons unrelatable and uninspiring. As I continued on my academic journey I was inundated with mind numbing lecture/worksheet based curriculum that just wasn't cutting it. Fed up with these non-engaging pedagogies, I decided it was time to do something and make a change.
