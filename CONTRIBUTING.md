### Why  

Often students can view scientific exploration as something left to the professionals. Using a strong, engaging narrative, coupled with hands-on applicable science, and real-time connection to professional scientists, young explorers can more easily find themselves the main characters in a story of discovery they are helping to write.

This documents is a set of guidelines for contributing to The Aquarius Project on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.


## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/blob/master/CODE%20OF%20CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [cbreskyATadlerplanetarium.org].

## What we're working on

* **We are using ongoing science stories to produce interactive hands-on lesson plans in STEM.**  We are using real science happening today to engage students not only with its relevance but with their ability to contribute, and incorporating that into content for studdents and educators to use.

## How can you help?

 ### 1. Be Curious. 
 [Learn about the meteor fall that sparked this project](https://openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com/expedition/rovmeteoritehunt). 
 
   * **Ask a question** & post to Twitter w/ #AquariusAMA** that you'd like a scientist/educator to answer for you inspired by [the project](https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/education/far-horizons/the-aquarius-project/). (*Example:"How hot was the meteorite (space rock) when it hit the water?"* #AquariusAMA ) 
     * **Science Professionals will be monitoring #AquariusAMA from 1-2pm CST (6-7pm UTC) on May 10th & 11th during the Global Sprint**
   * **Post your question** and the response you receive! We'll use these to help design and direct new lesson content. [Post your questions and answers here!](https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/2) 
 
 ### 2. Be a Translator. 
 Help us translate the text from one of our digital lessons into another language. [Contribute here!](https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/1)
 
 ### 3. Be a Resource Contributor.
We invite scientists (and citizen scientists) of diverse backgrounds to contribute resources (online links, twitter/email for direct communication) that could help answer questions from #2 and, if you are willing provide your contact info to be a resource for future students/educators. [Post them here!](https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/3)
 
 ### 4. Be a Storyteller. 
If you are a science communicator, educator, scientist, or citizen scientist with a camera, record yourself answering a question from [Issue 2]((https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/2) ). Record from your phone or laptop (clear sound but doesn't need to be fancy) and [post your video link here](https://github.com/chrisbresky/Aquarius-Project/issues/4).
